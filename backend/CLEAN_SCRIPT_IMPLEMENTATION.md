# Clean Script Implementation - Example Usage

## AI Generation Example

When the AI generates content, it will now call `save_content` with both script formats:

### Input to AI:

"Create a reel about anteaters for a wildlife education channel"

### AI calls save_content with:

```json
{
  "hook": "Did you know anteaters can eat 30,000 ants in one day?",
  "script": "[0-3s] Amazing anteater fact with close-up of snout\n[3-8s] Show anteater using its long tongue to catch ants\n[8-15s] Explain how their 2-foot tongue works with sticky saliva\n[15-22s] Mention they have no teeth but crush insects with powerful jaws\n[22-27s] Show unique fur pattern used for camouflage\n[27-30s] CTA: Follow for more amazing animal facts!",
  "cleanScript": "Did you know anteaters can eat 30,000 ants in one day? Let me show you how these incredible creatures use their amazing adaptations. Watch as this anteater extends its two-foot long tongue, covered in sticky saliva, to capture ants with incredible precision. What's fascinating is that anteaters have no teeth at all - they rely on their powerful jaws to crush their insect meals. Their unique fur pattern also provides perfect camouflage in their natural habitat. If you want to learn more amazing animal facts, make sure to follow for more content!",
  "caption": "Anteaters can eat 30,000 ants/day! 🐜 Mind-blowing nature facts 🤯",
  "hashtags": ["wildlife", "animals", "nature", "education", "viral"],
  "cta": "Follow for more amazing animal facts",
  "contentType": "full_script"
}
```

## What Gets Stored in Database

### generated_content table:

- `generatedScript`: "[0-3s] Amazing anteater fact with close-up of snout..."
- `cleanScriptForAudio`: "Did you know anteaters can eat 30,000 ants in one day? Let me show you..."

## What TTS Receives

The AudioPanel now sends `cleanScriptForAudio` to the TTS service:

**Before (would sound like):**
"Zero to three seconds amazing anteater fact with close-up of snout. Three to eight seconds show anteater using its long tongue..."

**After (sounds natural):**
"Did you know anteaters can eat 30,000 ants in one day? Let me show you how these incredible creatures use their amazing adaptations..."

## Video Production Still Works

The `generatedScript` field with timestamps is still available for video production workflows, maintaining backward compatibility.

**Editor vs generation:** `buildInitialTimeline` does **not** read `generatedScript`. The editor timeline is built from linked **assets** (`content_assets`). The caption/text track uses composed copy: **`generated_hook`**, **`clean_script_for_audio`** (natural language, same idea as TTS — not timestamped script), and **`generated_caption`**, in that order with blank lines between sections. Only the video job (`runReelGeneration`) parses `generatedScript` via `parseScriptShots` to call providers.

## Testing the Implementation

1. Generate new content in the chat
2. Open the Audio Panel
3. The script textarea should show clean text without timestamps
4. Generate voiceover - it should sound natural without reading timestamps

## Migration Status
